About this project
==================

This project was realised during my first year of Master in computer science at the `University of Angers <http://www.univ-angers.fr/fr/index.html>`_ for a collaboration between `LERIA <http://blog.univ-angers.fr/leria/>`_ and `MolTech Anjou <http://moltech-anjou.univ-angers.fr/>`_. The objective was to study the work done by Xiufeng Yang et al. with `ChemTS <https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00616>`_ and Masato Sumita et al. `Hunting for Organic Molecules with Artificial Intelligence <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00213>`_ and try to reproduce it from the code of ChemTS on `Github <https://github.com/tsudalab/ChemTS>`_ an look for improvement.
