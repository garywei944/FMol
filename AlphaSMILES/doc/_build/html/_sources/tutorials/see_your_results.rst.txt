Just looking at the json file is quite difficult to analyze, so we created a function to plot wavelengths and a 2D representation.

The script is in *'tools/request.py'* and call *'tools/plot_wavelength.py'* allow you to generate those representation by using the function *find*.


.. autofunction:: tools.request.find
