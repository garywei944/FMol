Generate SMILE molecular with AlphaSMILE, predict protein tertiary structure with AlphaFold, and interact them with fPocket to approach a solution of drug discovery.

## Done and Todo
As we can tell from the descrption, there would be 3 parts of the project(molecule, protein, and mol-x-protein). I have merged and am currently working on the smile molecure generating part. 

## Copyright Clain
To make the project easier to deploy on the cloud, I copied and merged some repos into this project according to their licence.
